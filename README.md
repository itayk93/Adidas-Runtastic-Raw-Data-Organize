Hey! This code purpose is to organise the input json files which contains runnings data from Adidas Runtastic App.
It organises the data into an input file to upload to any BI system (in my cace - Tableau)

Instructions:

Export the raw data from the Runtastic website by submitting a request on the website. The raw data will be sent to you via email within a few days.
After receiving the email from Runtastic with the data, download it and locate it in the "Exported Input Data" folder, which is in the "Input" folder.
In the "data_to_cancel.xlsx" file, specify any specific data you want to delete from the final data before uploading it to a BI system (you can copy the data from the output after running the script).
In the "dates_to_cancel.xlsx" file, specify any dates you want to delete from the final data before uploading it to a BI system.
In the "main_folder_location.xlsx" file, specify the location of your folder.
In the "min_average_speed.xlsx" file, specify the minimum average speed you want to include in the final data. This is useful for removing data that may skew the results, such as runs that were accidentally tracked.
Finally, you can run the "Organize Data - Runtastic App.py" script.

Thank you for using this software.
